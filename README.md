## Forword

-In the video demo of the programs running the rover appears at a constant speed but that is just because I held the joystick fully down during the demo, the speed will vary (PWM) depending on how extended the joystick is. 

-For the client GUI translation of what is happening to the rover during turns the rover doesn't turn around the center of it's body. I wasn't able to fix this is the time I allowed myself to work on the task since midterms are about to start and I need to focus on those. If I have time before the final submission date I will try to fix it.
